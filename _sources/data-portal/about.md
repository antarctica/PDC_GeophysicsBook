# About

The [Polar Airborne Geophysics Data Portal](https://www.bas.ac.uk/project/nagdp/) is a map-based app that allows users to discover
the polar airborne geophysics datasets that are stored at the UK Polar Data Centre. 
Through its user-friendly interface, the user can have a first quicklook at the data 
and discover the great resource that we hold. The data consists of airborne gravity, magnetics 
and radar data. In total, it's almost 450,000 line kilometers of data that is freely available.
