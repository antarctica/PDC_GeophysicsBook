# About

[BEDMAP3](https://scar.org/science/bedmap3/about/) is a major collaborative project led by the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) that aims to produce a new map and datasets of Antarctic ice thickness and bed topography for the international glaciology and geophysical community. 

We present in this book the different codes that have been used to create the shapefiles used in the BEDMAP3 data portal as well as ways to read, and calculate key parameters from the datasets.
