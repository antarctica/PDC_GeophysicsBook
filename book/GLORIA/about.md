# About
GLORIA (Geological Long-Range Inclined Asdic) is a side-scan sonar instrument which acquires acoustic images of the seafloor. It is an instrument that has been intensively used to map the seafloor in the 1980s and 1990s. In 2025, the UK Polar Data Centre published the GLORIA data from the RRS Charles Darwin CD37 cruise (January â€“ April 1989). The study area was the Scotia Sea, North Scotia Ridge (NSR), South Sandwich Island, South Sandwich Arc, and West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) continental shelf, within the broader region of the Southern Ocean.

We present in this book different codes to open, read and visualise the GLORIA data
